# Shuffz Mixed Algo Miner

Most the time I use HiveOS for mining various cryptocurrency with my GPU's. But sometimes when working native Linux systems without any mining software pre-installed it can be time consuming setting up mining software.

This script is designed to mine whatever cryptocurrency the user chooses only asking the user for the pool address and wallet address as input.

You can help us with the devolpment of this script by donating one or more CPU cores to our project we will use these cores to mine VRSC.
